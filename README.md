<h1 align="center"><strong>Hi, I'm Arturo Rivera</strong></h1>
<h3 align="center"><strong>A passionate frontend developer from Mexico</strong></h3>

I am a fullstack developer who thrives on continuous learning and innovation in the ever-evolving realm of technology. As a recent graduate in mechatronics engineering, my journey has been anchored in programming. Over the past year, I have dedicated myself to the world of web development, immersing myself in both frontend and backend technologies.

My github user is inspired by my little four-legged best friend called House, who was with me for more than a decade and who is one of my fundamental pillars in my continuous learning and growth. Among those whom I dedicate all my efforts and work to this day and to come, Housito is among them.
